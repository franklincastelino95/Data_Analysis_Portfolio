    "The analysis shows that employee attrition is strongly influenced by job tenure and early role experience. Employees who are new to their roles or have fewer working years are more likely to leave, highlighting the importance of effective onboarding and early engagement. By combining Power BI visual analytics with machine learning, this project demonstrates how HR data can be transformed into actionable insights to support employee retention and workforce planning."
