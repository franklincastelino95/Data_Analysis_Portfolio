#  Data Analysis Portfolio

## About
My portfolio showcases a selection of hands-on data analysis projects focused on real-world problems. The work includes HR attrition analysis, where I explored factors influencing employee turnover, and healthcare-focused studies examining the relationship between sleep, cigarette smoking, and the rise of chronic conditions. Each project emphasizes practical data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and insight-driven storytelling, with a focus on turning raw data into clear, actionable conclusions.
